# About The Project

This library was designed to be a sweet spot between sophisticated, and sometimes even overwhelming solutions such as [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) and a often too simplistic ones such as React's `useReducer`.

Florence state machine is not a global state manager, but a lightweight tool to handle complex UI logic in a type-safe and declarative style.
